This is a personal mini project I made to get started with Git and Github.

It is a python program in which you input your directory's path and it will organise
the directory's content by moving all the files (not directories) into their
respective directories based on their extensions, i.e., if there are 2 pdfs and 2 ppts
and pdf directory already exists and ppt directory doesn't exist, the program will
create a ppt directory and then move the pdfs and ppts in their respective directories.
